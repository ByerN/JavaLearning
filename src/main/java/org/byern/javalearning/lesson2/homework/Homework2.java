     * There are two rectangles.
     *
     * Properties that describes rectangles are: x, y, w, h
     * x,y -> rectangle left-bottom corner coordinates
     * w -> width
     * h -> height
     *
     *
     * 1. Read properties x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2 from input (Scanner usage)
     * 2. Store it in variables
     * 3a. If rectangles are colliding with each other (overlapping), print "Collision detected!"
     * 3b. else -> print "Collision not detected!"
     *
     * If the smaller one is in the bigger one it's still collision.
     * Inclusive collision.
     *
     * Advanced:
     * -Read a boolean flag from input that says if collision check is inclusive or exclusive
     *  and use it in collision calculation (true -> inclusive, false -> exclusive)
     *
     * Hint:
     * -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws
