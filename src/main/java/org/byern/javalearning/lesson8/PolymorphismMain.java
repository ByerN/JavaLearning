     * Polymorphism paradigm - ability of an being to behave differently according
     * to kind of object which are they referring to.
     *
     * Polymorphism and abstraction are strictly correlated which makes those two hard to understand.
     * In fact, polymorphism works in opposite way to abstraction.
     *
     * Abstraction is an mechanism of generalisation.
     * Polymorphism is an mechanism of specification.
     *
     * Polymorphism in Java can be resolved in some ways:
     * -Method overriding - mechanism of changing/implementing behavior of methods inherited
     *      from superclass or interface. It makes object to act different according to type.
     * -Method overloading - mechanism of specifying "same" method to resolve different type.
     * -Generics (later)
     * -other things that fits this paradigm (e.g. coercion -> type casting)
     *
     * Overriding is dynamic. Resolves in runtime time (dynamic binding).
     * Overloading is static. Resolves in compile time (static binding).
