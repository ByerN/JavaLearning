         * Program should:
         * -read source filename
         * -read destination filename
         * -read shift value
         * -encrypt source file content and write it into destination file
         *
         * *There is no need of creating new file on the fly (only existing files, otherwise exception).
         * *It should work for byte value for making it simpler. Not only characters. Simple shift.
         *
         * Properly made program should be able to recover encrypted file with
         * encrypting it again with reversed shift.
