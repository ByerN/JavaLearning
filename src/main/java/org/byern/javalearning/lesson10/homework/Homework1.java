     * Use class from Homework0 in this one.
     *
     * Create a program that sorts collection of this class instances (class created in Homework0)
     * in order provided in Homework0. It means that:
     *
     * first compare firstName
     * second compare lastName if firstNames are equal
     * compare age if equal firstNames and lastNames
     *
     * All of those are nullable.
     * Null is first in order.
     * It means that if
     * a1.firstName == "Joanna"
     * a2.firstName == null
     *
     * a2 is first and other fields are not compared.
     *
     * Implement it as separate comparator class (don't implement compareTo in this class).
     * Create a main method for testing with best example instances selected.
     *
     * Man should be able to select ascending or descending order. Could be provided as constructor argument
     * in comparator class.
